I am passionate about the Bitcoin industry and its developments worldwide, particularly from a monetary policy and libertarian perspective. I strongly believe in education and onboarding via content curation and I enjoy the creative process of doing so.

You should definitely check out my Bitcoin project, [**WORDS**](https://bitcoinwords.github.io/) which is a monthly journal.

For the past couple years, I have been a Senior Marketing Manager for [HPE](https://www.hpe.com/). Prior to marketing, I carried a bag in a sales role at HPE for 6 years. Before that I sold [beer](http://diamondbear.com/), [industrial hydraulics](https://www.fainc.net/), and even sneakers.
I hold a B.S.B.A. in Marketing from [Christian Brothers University](https://www.cbu.edu/) in Memphis, TN.

I am happily married and have two amazing kiddos and two sub-optimal doggos.

I also have a [trash blog](https://jrjr.posthaven.com/) that is a bunch of screenshots from twitter and not very thoughtful. You shouldn't read it.
