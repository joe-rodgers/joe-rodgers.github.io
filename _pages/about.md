## Hello! I'm Joe Rodgers

Since 2020, I've been busy building at Bitcoin Magazine, focusing on shipping products that resonate with our audience. My journey with Bitcoin started in the late 2010s, leading me to a vibrant Twitter community of like-minded enthusiasts. It was this connection that brought me to Bitcoin Magazine, where I contribute to our collective vision.

## Background & Expertise

Before my foray into Bitcoin, I spent a decade at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), mastering various roles in sales and marketing for datacenter infrastructure. This experience sharpened my skills in email marketing funnels, print magazine creation, e-commerce management, and general sales and marketing, which I now apply in my current role.

## My Values & Passions

Professionally, I value honesty and follow-through above all. I'm deeply passionate about technologies that empower individuals and enhance freedom, with a particular interest in the transformative power of Bitcoin.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, I have a diverse range of interests. I'm an avid collector of dissident writings and magazines, delving into the rich world of thought and expression that challenges the status quo. Additionally, Bitcoin Art captures my imagination, reflecting the intersection of finance, technology, and creativity. These passions complement my other hobbies in 3D printing, bitcoin mining, and a love for cooking, especially grilling and smoking.

## Goals & Aspirations

My primary goal is to instill my values in my family, especially my girls, preparing them for a future filled with opportunities. I aspire to share my knowledge and expertise with a wider audience through education and philanthropy in the future.

## Working Style

I believe in hard work, balanced with a casual and enjoyable approach. The key is to be effective while having fun in the process.
