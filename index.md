intro: 
  - excerpt: "Iâ€™m an enterprise technology marketer, salesman, Bitcoin hodler, barbeque enthusiast, and a Dad. My journey as a first college graduate to business owner has provided valuable business and life lessons. I graduated from Christian Brothers University, and was also a Men's Soccer Letterman. I've sold hardware, software, sneakers, and beer. Right now I'm focused on enterprise technology marketing at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I am a Bitcoin hodler who eats far too much barbeque and I love my family."
