I bought a new mobo today at Microcenter in hopes of fixing my mining rig. I got home installed it, then as it posted, I read an article about using the OEM cables on all outputs on the PSU. Several hours later and many headaches I was almost there.

  You won&#8217;t believe this. One of my problems was a broken power switch. Then I found out my good original EVGA PSU was broke. I thought that was still Rock solid.

  After all this bullshit I got the rig back running and was installing the final GPU. I was so anxious to get it installed, I plugged in the vga to the power supply and the rig went dark. Completely unresponsive.

  I either killed the GPU, PSU, Motherboard, or a combination of the three.
