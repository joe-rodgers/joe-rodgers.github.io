I read a tweet a while back saying the USPS was scanning all our mail. I thought that was pretty rad. Turns out it&#8217;s true and you can see it first hand. Go to their website, register, and setup Informed Delivery. Here you&#8217;ll be able to see mail headed your way. Doesn&#8217;t look like they are capturing junk mail. Makes me wonder who is running the spam filter.
