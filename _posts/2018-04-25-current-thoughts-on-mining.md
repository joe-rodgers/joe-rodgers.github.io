Just so you know, I&#8217;ve tried dual mining ETH and PASC, solo mining XMR and solo mining ETH. As of today, XMR has the best payout but only by about $10 per month more than ETH. The question is which coin you see sticking around long term or getting the most gains in the next X months (however long you plan on staying in the game). Since ETH is (slowly) moving to POS, I am trying to stock up as much Ether as as possible so I can have a share in a POS pool once it goes live. Once that happens and POW is shut off, I&#8217;ll pivot to XMR or whatever is viable at that time.
