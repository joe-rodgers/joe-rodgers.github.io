## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to include a lightning network faucet in an email newsletter.

### WHY WOULD YOU WANT A FAUCET IN A NEWSLETTER?
Great question. Maybe you want to reward readers. Maybe you've got a sponsor and they want to reward your readers. Maybe you want to send a faucet to readers ONLY IF they complete a certain action. Maybe you're generous and want to share some love.

I don't care about your reason! I want to show you how to do this!

## Tools
I will be using Paywall.Link and Mailchimp as my primary tools for this tutorial. Go setup accounts for these tools and then come back!

[Go to Paywall.Link](https://paywall.link/){: .btn .btn--primary}
[Go to Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/){: .btn .btn--primary}

### Paywall.Link setup that faucet
First things first, you've got to get a faucet setup. I am assuming you've got a fresh account with Paywall.Link and are ready to change the world. 

You need to make a faucet. Click the button that's circled below:
