I bought all the components yesterday, built it last night, and the fucker wouldn&#8217;t boot. I spoke with Microcenter tech support and we think it&#8217;s the motherboard.

It&#8217;s the Asus B250 Expert Mining board.

It has 19 slots for GPU which is bonkers.

I am returning it and have an Asrock H110 Pro BTC+ on the way from Amazon. Next Wednesday is delivery so I&#8217;m tabling the project until then.

I don&#8217;t have a chassis for the components so this delay will give me time to build it.
