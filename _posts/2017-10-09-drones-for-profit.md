        I&#8217;m sitting here watching Droneweek, hyped up about the FPV racing drones. This is definitely gonna be huge.

        I&#8217;ve thought drones are a huge market opportunity and here are a couple ideas I&#8217;ve been kicking around for a year or so&#8230;.

            <b>Drone Security</b> &#8211; this would be an aerial drone surveillance and security company that could patrol or be dispatched upon command. Think if you had a large property and an intruder was detected and a drone could be dispatched to film and shout Commands at the intruder, that would be scary/valuable.

          <li>
            <b>Event audio video</b> &#8211; specifically youth sports. You&#8217;d need a drone and operator with 4k camera. Additional cameras on ground and an film editor. I believe you could capture up to $500 per game for film. Think about signing a deal with a team that youd film all their games and roll that cost into team dues&#8230; there&#8217;s plenty of parents who&#8217;d pay that extra $50 per game to have their kids games on film&#8230;. Unless they ride the bench.

            <b>NEW CONCEPT THANKS DRONEWEEK</b> &#8211;Â Inspection drones &#8211; quickly inspect street structures via drone and high powered camera.
