      After 12 hours of running with all the cards loaded, I experienced continuous crashing and BSOD.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I troubleshooted to the best of my ability by reloaded drivers, swapping cards on PCI slots, and even botting 1 card at a time to see where the problem was originating.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After all that work, my conclusion is that my power supply (1000w Platinum) can&#8217;t handle all the cards under 100% load.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On a side note, I ordered a XFX Vega 64 today&#8230;. pretty cool shit. Awesome hashrates from my research.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am now considering my next move&#8230; is it an additional rig or scale out this one.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Also, I am not sure how the Vega card is going to play with my 1070 ti&#8217;s.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We&#8217;ll just have to wait and see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My dream rig would be to have a proper frame with an all Vega build out but I don&#8217;t know how I can get my hands on that many cards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I will keep you posted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      P.S. So you&#8217;re probably asking yourself what I&#8217;m doing with that extra 1070ti&#8230; I loaded it in my personal desktop and my 43&#8243; 4K TV is running games at ultra without hesitation. Not sure if i will load up Claymore to run over nite but that probably makes sense.
