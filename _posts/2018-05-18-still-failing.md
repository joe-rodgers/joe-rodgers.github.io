I received and installed my new EVGA PSU today and guess what, it wouldn&#8217;t boot. It was just like the last one. I&#8217;ve ordered replacement cables that split the 24 pin MB connector because the one I currently have is very cheap. I&#8217;m hoping the current cord is so cheap that&#8217;s it&#8217;s preventing a good signal from hitting the PSU and triggering boot process. We&#8217;ll know tomorrow because that&#8217;s when I get the new cable.
