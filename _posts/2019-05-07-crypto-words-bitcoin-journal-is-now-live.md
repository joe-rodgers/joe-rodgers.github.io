It&#8217;s been mighty quiet on the personal blog front. So here&#8217;s what has happened.

I launched a Bitcoin project called Crypto Words. Its a monthly journal of Bitcoin commentary.

It&#8217;s taken quite a bit of time as I am curating content real time, but also archiving past content going back years.

This has been very labor some and requires the dreaded spreadsheet! Find a post, save it to spreadsheet, go back to post, convert html to markdown, etc&#8230;.

Anyway, we&#8217;re live and it is awesome.

Check it out:
