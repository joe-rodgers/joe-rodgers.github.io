      This guy. After weeks of being pissed off at my miner, countless hours building rebuilding and being pissed off, new hardware, etc, I think I&#8217;ve got my shit back together.</p>

      FUCK YOU WINDOWS UPDATES</p>
    </div>
    
    <div dir="auto">
      I installed an old version of Windows tonight, I think 1607, and turned off all auto updates, installed drivers, synced OneDrive, and Bam, started mining. The rig is running SOOOOO much fatser with all the cards thanks to this old windows kernel.</p>

      Here&#8217;s a handy checklist for myself:</p>
