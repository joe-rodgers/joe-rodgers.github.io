My miner is still down thanks to that Windows update. I reinstalled windows and drivers and had no luck getting the rig to boot when all the GPU&#8217;s were loaded. I tried booting with and without GPU on each PSU separately and I believe the cheap PSU I got a couple months ago is a weak link in the chain. After the Windows update, the Vega cards powered by the cheap PSU we&#8217;re showing a single green led, which indicates insufficient power. Amazon is delivering an EVGA replacement today so let&#8217;s hope for stable booting and long times between reboot.
