I experienced the call screening feature on my Pixel XL 2 today. The service will prompt you with a button to screen the call, it transcribes the voice on the other line near real time and prompts you with replies at lightning speed. The call I received WAS spam, and it was a pleasure to use the call screening service. I really can&#8217;t wait to use call screening on my wife. Good times.
