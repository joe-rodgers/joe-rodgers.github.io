This makes so much sense it hurts. I read that Mexico offered asylum to the caravan but they refused it and continued marching north towards the US. If that&#8217;s true, it really makes me question their motive. If they turned down asylum to neighboring countries and kept marching north, there has to be more motive than safety. My guess on the motive is an economic motive. Why stop marching in Mexico with the free handouts across the border to the north? I hate seeing the pictures of the women and children caught in the crossfire. Any mother who would March with her children. From Central America to the US is certainly seeking asylum and a better quality of life, but there had to be order to immigration.
