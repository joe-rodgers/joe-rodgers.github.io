I am passionate about the Bitcoin industry and its developments worldwide, particularly from a monetary policy and libertarian perspective. I strongly believe in education and onboarding via content curation and I enjoy the creative process of doing so.

For the past year, I have been the US Marketing Manager for HPE covering the Telco vertical. Prior to marketing, I carried a bag in a sales role at HPE for 6 years. Before that I sold [beer](http://diamondbear.com/), [industrial hydraulics](https://www.fainc.net/), and even sneakers.
I hold a B.S.B.A. in Marketing from [Christian Brothers University](https://www.cbu.edu/) in Memphis, TN. 

I am happily married and have two amazing kiddos and two sub-optimal doggos.

## Things I love:
Grilling, all barbeque, brisket cooked just right, soccer, Delta Blues, tamales, hot sauce, enterprise technology, the crypto industry, the internet, dive bars, live music, fold out chairs outside, cherries, Busch Light, Bitcoin, Land Rovers, liberty, sound money, anything on [Mises.org](https://mises.org/).
